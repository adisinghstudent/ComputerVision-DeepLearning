# TDT4265 - Computer Vision and Deep Learning

This is the repository for the assignments in TDT4265. Originally written by HÃ¥kon Hukkelas. Maintained and updated by Michael Staff Larsen.

## Overview

The assignment grading will be conducted through our INGInious web server at [https://visualcomputing.idi.ntnu.no/](https://visualcomputing.idi.ntnu.no/). Please note that VPN is nesecary when accessing the site outside the NTNU network. For VPN installation and configuration, see [https://i.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/English/Install+VPN](https://i.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/English/Install+VPN)


The purpous of the starter code is to enable you to test your code before submitting to the grading server.


Delivery dates:

1. Assignment 1: Friday February 7th, 23:59 PM
2. Assignment 2: Friday February 21st ,23:59 PM
3. Assignment 3: Friday March 7th, 23:59 PM
3. Assignment 4: Friday March 21st, 23:59 PM

The starting source code for each assignment will be published during the semester.


### Assignment 1
This assignment will give you an introduction to basic image processing with python, filtering in the spatial domain, and a simple introduction to building fully-connected neural networks with PyTorch.



## Preparing yourself for the assignments
In this course, we expect basic knowledge of python programming and git. To refresh your knowledge, we recommend the following resources:

- [CS231N Python Numpy Tutorial](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/)
- [Introduction to git](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/)

### Setting up your environment
In this course, all assignments are given in python. You can do the assignments on the following resources:

- Your own computer: Follow our [python setup instructions](tutorials/python_setup_instructions.md) to setup your own environment
- Cybele computers: The environment is already setup for you, check out our [practical information](working_on_cybele_computers.md) on how to work on these computers

### Download the starter code

Clone this repostiory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TDT4265-tutorial/TDT4265_StarterCode_2025.git
```

You can also download this repository as a zip file and unzip it on your computer.


**There might be minor typos or minor alterations to the starter code**. If this happens, we will notify you on blackboard and you can update your starter code by doing (In your assignment directory):

```
git pull origin main
```

**If you wish to commit your changes to your own Git repo**, you can do so by:
1. Creating an empty private repository
2. While inside the starter code directory, run `git remote rename origin upstream`
3. `git remote add origin YOUR_REPO_URL`
4. `git push -u origin main`



*************


Then, when a new change is added to the upstream repo, you can add it to your own repo by running:
1. `git pull upstream main`
2. `git push`

*Note:* it is recommended to use git through a client like VS Code and sign in with your GitHub user. If you use git in a terminal, you may need to authenticate with GitHub with a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) as your password.
